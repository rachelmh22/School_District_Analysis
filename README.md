# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis was to help Maria analyze student funding and student test scores. The analysis of this student information will give insights to the school board to make decisions in regards to budget allocation. We are illustrating and helping them understand the trends in school performance based on what funding the school gets and how students perform on math and reading. After the analysis was complete, we learned the scores from the 9th graders at Thomas High School could be inaccurate and there could be some academic dishonesty in the results. Therefore, we are tasked to replace these scores from the data and reanalyze the information so the school board can make decisions on nudge allocation without the dishonest data.

## Results

- As seen below, since the scores of the students in the 9th grade at Thomas High School are replaced, the total number of students has changed. In addition, this affects the passing percentage for math, reading, and the overall percentage of students passing. All these numbers are lower with the replacement of the 9th grader’s scores at Thomas High School. The numbers unaffected are the total budget and the average math and reading score. The total budget is not affected by the 9th graders so there are no changes. The average scores are a mean of all the scores from all students from all schools. This is a very large number and replacing only the 9th graders at Thomas High School does not affect the mean greatly.

- The school summary data is largely unaffected, except for the scores and passing percentage for Thomas High School. All the student data for the other schools are intact so their results are the same. However Thomas High School, since there is some data change, all the numbers have gone down very slightly, except the average reading score, which has gone up.

- Replacing the 9th grader’s scores does not affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools. We can see in the school summary data that the numbers are different from the results with the 9th grader’s scores but there is no significant change because Thomas High School is still ranked the 2nd highest performing school when we look at the top schools based on the overall passing percentage.

- Replace the 9th grader’s scores has no affect on the reading scores and math scores for other grades, even the ones at Thomas High School. This replacement only affects the 9th graders at Thomas High School

- The scores of the students grouped by school spending is not significantly affected. Thomas High School is in the $631 to $645 spending range and the replacement of the 9th grader’s scores do not significantly affect the scores by spending. There are some difference in the scores if we look into the hundredth decimal place but this does not impact the results significantly. 

- The scores by school size give the same results as the scores by school spending. There are very small changes in the decimal places of the scores and percentages for the medium school size since Thomas High School is a medium school size. Like the scores by school spending, the change is not significant and do not impact the results.

- Finally, the scores by school type also has the same analysis as scores by school size and school spending. There are no changes significant enough to impact the results. 

## Summary

Four changes in the updated school district analysis are:
- a lower average math score
- a lower passing math percentage 
- a lower passing reading percentage 
- a lower overall passing percentage 

While these scores and percentages are lower with the replace if the scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School, it does not significantly impact the results. The school board can continue with similar or the same discussions and decisions they had before the updated analysis.
